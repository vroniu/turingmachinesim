# Turing Machine Simulator
Turing Machine simulator in Java, with CLI interface.

## Features so far
  - Run single-tape Turing Machines
  - Save and load machines using .json files
  - Change settings like default machines depository, default blank symbol etc.

## How to set it up
This app WONT work in normal Windows cmd - the colored output isn't supported there. You will need a custom terminal app - I recomend Windows Terminal. It works fine in default Linux terminal.
Make sure you have Java installed. Then, just run the app using 
``` 
java -jar tm-sim-0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
